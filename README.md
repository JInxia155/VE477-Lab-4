Goals of the lab

    Course application

    Data sctructures

    Python Object Oriented Programming

Unless specified otherwise, all the programs are expected to be completed in Python or O’caml.

1. In a class implement all the following operations for the Fibonacci Heap data structure.

• MakeHeap • ExtractMin • Delete

• Insert • Union

• Minimum • DecreaseKey

Note: define a clean and clear API as Fibonacci Heaps are to be reused in a future lab.

    Present the time complexity of each operation.

    Comparing the Fibonacci heap to the simple min-heap and identify the advantages and disadvan-tages of Fibonacci heap.

    Explain in which circumstances Fibonacci heaps should be preferred over other types of heap.
